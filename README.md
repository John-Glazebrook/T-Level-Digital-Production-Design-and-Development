Hello.

This is a repo of resources for the T-Level in Digital Production, Design and Development.

These resources were created, with love, by the amazing team at Truro and Penwith College, in Cornwall.

Coding should be fun. The lectures and worksheets should be interesting, fun, amusing, silly, entertaining and challenging ... Teaching is serious. Learning should be fun.

Thanks,

John
