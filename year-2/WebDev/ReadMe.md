Each student will need various tools.

VSCode to edit code
XAMPP ( https://www.apachefriends.org/ ) to spin up a webserver and database
(If you don't like XAMPP, try https://laragon.org/)

You may wish to send emails from PHP, gmail and outlook will both allow you to do this. 
The student will use PHP to connect to the SMTP server using their email address and password. Create burner accounts for this.

- XDebug (please install this - I have no idea how people code without a debugger (many years coding in industry experience))
- XDebug extension for chrome
- Xdebug plugin for VSCode

XDebug is a pain to set up, but SO worth the effort. Students can step through their code and fix problems themselves.
