hello

Lecturers - these are tools you will need:

You and all students will need an account on http://repl.it (new URL http://replit.com)

Microsofts VSCode with the Python debugger installed. You will start to introduce this to the students when their code gets to be around 80 - 100 lines long. Debugging data structures and functions is tricky without a debugger. Repl.it has one, but it's a bit rubbish.

You MUST show them these tools, and demonstrate good debugging practices, using the debugger and inspection tools. This will make your life easier.
