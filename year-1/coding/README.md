After Python there are lectures on:

Minecraft Education - this teaches JS (typescript) and flowcharts
C# - this solidifies JS (similar language) and teaches GUI

Lecturers - these are tools you will need:

You and all students will need an account on http://repl.it (new URL http://replit.com)

Microsofts VSCode (https://code.visualstudio.com/download) with the Python debugger installed. You will start to introduce this to the students when their code gets to be around 80 - 100 lines long. Debugging data structures and functions is tricky without a debugger. Repl.it has one, but it's a bit rubbish.

You MUST show them these tools, and demonstrate good debugging practices, using the debugger and inspection tools. This will make your life easier. https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=vscode+debug+python

Should students be using ChatGPT and codepilot? In my opinion, yes. Everyone in industry is using these tools to help them code, I think the students should also be using the most powerful tools available to them.
